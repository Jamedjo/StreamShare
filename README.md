About
-----

SteamShare is an Android tool for sharing RTSP links to other devices, to watch phone-only streams on a PC. The functionality is lightweight; it registers an Android intent to listen for rtsp:// links and passes these onto the Android share activity. Also included are basic instructions for using VLC to watch and record streams.
